# java-gradle-starter-project

Here is a starter project for the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Java with Gradle. 

This branch is dedicated to getting started with our early adopter release of the ARM Linux release.  The release is available as a Maven local install which can be requested by emailing   [ARM64LinuxNative@esri.com](ARM64LinuxNative@esri.com)

When you have been provided access to the release, once the maven local install script ('install-local.sh') has been run , this branch will allow you to create a basic app which can run on an ARM Linux machine.

The project includes the Gradle wrapper, so there is no need to install Gradle to run the app.

The app launches a window displaying a map.

## Instructions

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and select _File > Open..._.
2. Choose the java-gradle-starter-project directory and click _OK_.
3. Select _File > Project Structure..._ and ensure that the Project SDK and language level are set to use Java 11.
4. Open the Gradle view with _View > Tool Windows > Gradle_.
5. In the Gradle view, double-click `copyNatives` under _Tasks > build_. This will unpack the native library dependencies to $USER_HOME/.arcgis.

### Command Line

1. `cd` into the project's root directory.
2. Run `./gradlew clean build` on Linux/Mac or `gradlew.bat clean build` on Windows.
3. Run `./gradlew copyNatives` on Linux/Mac or `gradlew.bat copyNatives` on Windows. This will unpack the native library dependencies to $USER_HOME.arcgis.
4. Run `./gradlew run` on Linux/Mac or `gradlew.bat run` on Windows to run the app.

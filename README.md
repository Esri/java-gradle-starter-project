# java-gradle-starter-project

Here is a starter project for the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Java with Gradle. 

The project includes the Gradle wrapper, so there is no need to install Gradle to run the app.

The app launches a window displaying a map.

## Instructions

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and select _File > Open..._.
2. Choose the java-gradle-starter-project directory and click _OK_.
3. Select _File > Project Structure..._ and ensure that the Project SDK and language level are set to use Java 11.
4. Open the Gradle view with _View > Tool Windows > Gradle_.
5. In the Gradle view, double-click `copyNatives` under _Tasks > build_. This will unpack the native library dependencies to $USER_HOME/.arcgis.
6. In the Gradle view, double-click `run` under _Tasks > application_ to run the app.

### Eclipse

1. Open Eclipse and select _File > Import_.
2. In the import wizard, choose _Gradle > Existing Gradle Project_, then click _Next_.
3. Select the java-gradle-starter-project directory as the project root directory.
4. Click _Finish_ to complete the import.
5. Select _Project > Properties_ . In _Java Build Path_, ensure that under the Libraries tab, _Modulepath_ is set to JRE System Library (JavaSE-11). In _Java Compiler_, ensure that the _Use compliance from execution environment 'JavaSE-11' on the 'Java Build Path'_ checkbox is selected.
6. Right-click the project in the Project Explorer or Package Explorer and choose _Gradle > Refresh Gradle project_.
7. Open the Gradle Tasks view with _Window > Show View > Other... > Gradle > Gradle Tasks_.
8. In the Gradle Tasks view, double-click `copyNatives` under _java-gradle-starter-project > build_. This will unpack the native library dependencies to $USER_HOME/.arcgis.
9. In the Gradle Tasks view, double-click `run` under _java-gradle-starter-project > application_ to run the app.

### Command Line

1. `cd` into the project's root directory.
2. Run `./gradlew clean build` on Linux/Mac or `gradlew.bat clean build` on Windows.
3. Run `./gradlew copyNatives` on Linux/Mac or `gradlew.bat copyNatives` on Windows. This will unpack the native library dependencies to $USER_HOME.arcgis.
3. Run `./gradlew run` on Linux/Mac or `gradlew.bat run` on Windows to run the app.
